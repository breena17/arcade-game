## Instructions

## How to Play
The classic arcade game is Udacity's version of the famous arcade game Frogger. The goal of this game is to savely move your character across the road. Watch out for those pesky roaches! They'll reset your character to the beginning on your journey.

## Moving Your Character
Use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys to move your character across the board.

## Sources
I could not have completed this game without the help of the Udacity student community. Their insight and suggestions have been a huge help in learning more about object oriented JavaScript. 

Matthew Crawford's [Blog](https://matthewcranford.com/blog/) helped me initiate the game board and get past the initial console errors. His pseudo code really helped me develop a process for planning out how I want to write my code.
